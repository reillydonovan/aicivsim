  <h3>From lab curiosities to copilots.</h3>
  <p>Every conversation lately ends with "Where is AI going?" This post gives a human-readable timeline, then spells out the decisions that now matter — ownership, governance, agency.</p>
</div>

## Quick timeline

<div class="timeline">
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <p class="timeline-era">1950s &ndash; 1980s</p>
    <p class="timeline-title">Labs & logic</p>
    <p class="timeline-text">Robots were sci-fi mascots. Under the hood: symbolic AI, perceptrons, expert systems. Funding thawed and froze twice.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <p class="timeline-era">1990s &ndash; 2015</p>
    <p class="timeline-title">Narrow AI quietly helped</p>
    <p class="timeline-text">Search, spam filters, Netflix recs just "worked." Machine learning crushed specific tasks thanks to more data + cheaper compute.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <p class="timeline-era">2016 &ndash; 2022</p>
    <p class="timeline-title">AI leaves the lab</p>
    <p class="timeline-text">Voice assistants, face ID, AlphaGo headlines. Deep learning scaled; transformers + GPUs unlocked translation, image captioning, and more.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <p class="timeline-era">2023 &ndash; 2025</p>
    <p class="timeline-title">Generative boom</p>
    <p class="timeline-text">ChatGPT, Midjourney, Copilot made AI feel creative. Foundation models trained on web-scale corpora; inference costs dropped ~10x/year.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="timeline-item">
    <p class="timeline-era">2026+</p>
    <p class="timeline-title">Copilots, councils, co-ops</p>
    <p class="timeline-text">We're entering this stage now. Multimodal agents embed into every workflow; governance experiments race to catch up.</p>
  </div>

## Why average people should care

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--sky">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">&#x1F4C9;</div>
    <h4>Cost of prediction keeps dropping</h4>
    <p>Each breakthrough made "what happens next?" cheaper to answer. That's why AI now drafts emails, plans trips, and codes features in seconds.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--emerald">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">&#x1F504;</div>
    <h4>Tasks change faster than jobs disappear</h4>
    <p>AI autocompletes text, code, legal boilerplate. People still provide judgment, taste, accountability. The fight is over who owns the tools.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--violet">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">&#x2696;&#xFE0F;</div>
    <h4>Governance is finally real</h4>
    <p>EU AI Act, U.S. executive orders, civic AI charters, safety audits. We can choose whether AI acts like public infrastructure or a gated utility.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--amber">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">&#x1F9E0;</div>
    <h4>Next frontier = agent orchestration</h4>
    <p>Current chatbots answer questions; next-gen agents run multi-step missions. That demands better memory, verification layers, and resource caps.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## What "good" looks like

<div class="steps">
  <div class="step">
    <h4>Civic AI charters</h4>
    <p>Tie deployments to measurable human benefit — jobs, autonomy, ecological regeneration.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>Transition OS + civic dividends</h4>
    <p>Productivity gains fund mobility, not extraction.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>Participatory audits and councils</h4>
    <p>Citizens, labor orgs, and builders co-design rules.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>Compute co-ops and benefit corps</h4>
    <p>The infrastructure itself has public-purpose duties.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## What happens if we sleep on it

<div class="callout callout--danger">
  <p><strong>API tollbooths:</strong> A handful of foundation-model rentiers charge API tolls while monetizing our data with no reciprocity.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout--warning">
  <p><strong>Inequality amplified:</strong> Automation amplifies inequality because the dividend flows only to capital owners.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout--danger">
  <p><strong>Safety theater:</strong> Safety gets outsourced to PR teams instead of transparent, participatory review.</p>
</div>

  <h3>The governance window is open right now.</h3>
  <p>Most people engage with AI through the apps on their phone; they don't realize there's a governance window right now. Share this post with anyone who thinks AI is "just a chatbot."</p>
  <p>The decisions made in 2026 will decide whether we get co-workers that broaden opportunity — or black-box landlords that meter cognition.</p>
