  <h3>What's the score? And what happens if trends continue?</h3>
  <p>Every dashboard in the ecosystem now answers two questions: Where are we right now? And where are we headed? Baseline scores, letter grades, trend arrows, and scenario projections give an immediate, visceral sense of civilizational health across every domain.</p>

## The problem with dashboards

Most dashboards show you numbers. They don't tell you whether those numbers are _good_. A CO₂ reading of 424 ppm is meaningless without context: how far are we from safe? Is it getting better or worse? What happens if we don't change course?

This update adds three layers to every dashboard in the ecosystem:

1. **Today's Score** — a letter grade (A through F) and numeric score (0–100) for the current state of each domain
2. **Trend indicators** — arrows showing whether each metric is improving, stable, or declining
3. **Scenario projections** — what the score becomes by 2035 or 2050 depending on which future we choose

## What changed in each app

### ClimateOS: Today's Climate Score

The ClimateOS overview now opens with a circular scorecard grading Earth's climate across six domains:

- **Temperature Control** (D+, 58/100) — +1.2°C of our 1.5°C budget used ↓
- **Emissions** (D, 32/100) — 37.4 Gt/yr, need <25 Gt by 2030 →
- **Energy Transition** (C-, 45/100) — 4,500 GW renewables, ~30% of electricity ↑
- **Biodiversity** (D+, 40/100) — Index at baseline, 31% land protected ↓
- **Ocean Health** (D, 35/100) — pH 8.1, 30% coral health ↓
- **Resource Security** (D+, 42/100) — 26% water-stressed, 33% food waste ↓

**Overall: D+ (42/100)**. If trends continue (Business as Usual): **F (28/100)** by 2050. Under Aggressive Action: **A- (88/100)**.

The score updates dynamically as you toggle between scenarios, showing how each future changes not just the numbers but the grade.

### SimulationOS: Civilization Baseline Score

The Simulation dashboard now leads with a "Today's Civilization Score" computed from the starting state of all 12 branches. Five sub-scores — Equality, Civic Trust, Resilience, Decarbonization, and AI Governance — are derived from the simulation's structural metrics using the same composite scoring system that grades individual branches.

The scorecard also shows where bold action and status quo branches end up after 50 years, providing immediate stakes before you even interact with the branch explorer.

### CivilizationOS: Civilization Health Index

CivilizationOS becomes the **meta-scorecard** — the hub that aggregates scores from every other app in the ecosystem:

| Domain | Score | Grade | Trend | Source |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Climate & Environment | 42 | D+ | ↓ | ClimateOS |
| Governance & Institutions | 48 | D+ | ↓ | GovernanceOS |
| Workforce & Economy | 52 | C- | → | TransitionOS |
| Social Equity | 38 | D- | ↓ | CivilizationOS |
| Technology & AI | 55 | C | ↑ | Simulation |
| Civic Wellbeing | 45 | C- | → | CivilizationOS |

**Aggregate: D+ (47/100)**

Each domain card links to its source dashboard. With full intervention across all systems: **B+ (78/100)**. If trends continue: **F (22/100)**.

### TransitionOS: Scenario Toggle + Workforce Score

TransitionOS now follows the same interactive pattern as ClimateOS. The overview tab opens with a Transition Score (D+, 43/100) grading workforce readiness across Employment, Reskilling, Income Security, and Equity.

Three scenarios are now selectable with full chart highlighting and descriptive analysis:

- **Baseline (no intervention)** — chaos. Automation displaces, no safety net catches.
- **Transition OS only** — powerful but incomplete. Skills infrastructure without income bridging.
- **Full Stack (OS + Dividends + VPP)** — the only scenario that closes both the skills gap and the income gap.

Each chart highlights the active scenario, dims the others, and provides a descriptive paragraph explaining the trajectory. A comprehensive summary synthesizes all metrics at the bottom.

### GovernanceOS: Four Governance Scenarios

GovernanceOS receives the biggest upgrade — governance scenarios built from scratch:

- **Full Citizen Governance** — charter, assemblies, modules, 100% AI audit coverage, 95% participation
- **Moderate Reform** — partial adoption, 80% audit coverage, 76% participation
- **Minimal Tech-Only** — digital tools without civic infrastructure, 40% audit, 42% participation
- **Institutional Regression** — democratic backsliding, 1% audit, 15% participation

Two new scenario-aware charts project AI Audit Coverage and Civic Participation Rate across all four futures. The Governance Score (D, 40/100) grades Democratic Health, AI Oversight, Participation, and Accountability.

## The point

A letter grade does something a number can't: it makes you _feel_ the urgency. When you see D+ for civilization's climate health and realize the trend arrow points down, the abstract becomes concrete.

When you toggle to Aggressive Action and watch the grade climb to A-, you see that the distance between where we are and where we need to be isn't infinite — it's bridgeable. When you toggle to Worst Case and watch it drop to F, you see what's actually at stake.

The grades aren't prediction. They're orientation. They answer the question every person asking "is everything going to be okay?" actually needs answered: _not unless we do something different, and here's exactly what different looks like._
