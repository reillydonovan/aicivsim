  <h3>What happens to the planet if we act — or don't?</h3>
  <p>ClimateOS models four climate futures from now to 2050, across eight interconnected metrics. Toggle between aggressive action and worst case to see how every decision compounds across biodiversity, energy, food, water, and temperature.</p>

## Why another climate dashboard?

There's no shortage of climate data. What's missing is a tool that lets you _feel the difference_ between futures — to toggle between aggressive decarbonization and business as usual and watch every metric shift in response. ClimateOS was built to fill that gap.

It models **four scenarios** across **eight trajectory metrics**, with descriptive analysis beneath every chart and a comprehensive summary that synthesizes the full state of the world under each future. It's not a prediction — it's a comparison engine for consequences.

## The four scenarios

Each scenario represents a distinct trajectory of global climate action from 2026 to 2050. Every chart in the dashboard responds to the selected scenario, highlighting its trajectory while dimming the alternatives for comparison.

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--emerald">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">🌿</div>
    <h4>Aggressive Action</h4>
    <p>Full decarbonization by 2035, 99% renewables by 2050, net-negative emissions, forest cover to 42%, biodiversity recovery to 125% of baseline. Temperature stabilizes at +1.2°C. The best-case scenario — physically achievable but requiring unprecedented coordination.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--sky">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">🔄</div>
    <h4>Moderate Transition</h4>
    <p>Roughly aligned with current Paris Agreement pledges if fully implemented. 88% renewables by 2050, temperatures at +1.8°C, biodiversity stabilizing at 94. A world that avoids catastrophe but leaves razor-thin margins.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--amber">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">📊</div>
    <h4>Business as Usual</h4>
    <p>Current policies extended forward. 64% renewables, +3°C, half of biodiversity lost, crop yields down 31%, over one billion in hunger. Not a worst case — just the default trajectory of inaction.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--rose">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">🔥</div>
    <h4>Worst Case</h4>
    <p>Coordination failure and cascading tipping points. +4.6°C, 790 ppm CO₂, 81% biodiversity loss, 70% crop yield collapse, 88% water stress. The scenario where every system fails simultaneously.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Eight metrics, one interconnected system

The dashboard doesn't treat climate as a single number. It tracks eight metrics that interact across every scenario:

<div class="steps">
  <div class="step">
    <h4>🌡️ Global Temperature Rise</h4>
    <p>The defining metric. From +1.2°C (aggressive) to +4.6°C (worst case). Every fraction of a degree cascades through every other system.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>🌊 Sea Level Rise</h4>
    <p>49mm to over 1 meter by 2050. The difference between manageable adaptation and the displacement of hundreds of millions of people.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>💨 CO₂ Concentration</h4>
    <p>From 366 ppm (declining) to 790 ppm (accelerating). Whether atmospheric carbon peaks and falls or climbs without limit.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>🌿 Biodiversity Index</h4>
    <p>From 125 (recovery) to 19 (collapse). The living systems that pollinate crops, filter water, build soil, and regulate climate.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>⚡ Renewable Energy Share</h4>
    <p>From 99% (complete transition) to 42% (stalled). The pace of the energy transition determines everything else.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>🌾 Crop Yield Index</h4>
    <p>From +23% (improved) to -70% (collapse). Whether we feed 9 billion people or face famine as a leading cause of death.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>💧 Water Stress</h4>
    <p>From 15% to 88% of population affected. Water scarcity is the crisis multiplier that compounds every other failure.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>🌲 Forest Cover</h4>
    <p>From 42% (reforested) to 8.5% (collapsed). Forests are the planet's largest carbon sink and its richest biodiversity reservoir.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Six tabs, six lenses

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--emerald">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">📊</div>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Real-time metrics, scenario comparison cards, and the big picture — current state of the climate alongside where each scenario leads by 2050.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--sky">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">🔮</div>
    <h4>Scenarios</h4>
    <p>Toggle between all four futures. Eight comparison charts, each with a scenario-specific analysis paragraph and a comprehensive summary at the bottom describing the full state of the climate.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--violet">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">🌿</div>
    <h4>Biodiversity & Ecosystems</h4>
    <p>Species data, ecosystem status cards, biodiversity index and forest cover trajectories by scenario, restoration project progress, and scenario-aware analysis.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--amber">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">⚡</div>
    <h4>Energy & Emissions</h4>
    <p>Grid mix baseline, sectoral emissions breakdown, historical trends, and forward projections for CO₂, renewables, and temperature — all scenario-toggled with analysis.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--rose">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">💧</div>
    <h4>Resources & Agriculture</h4>
    <p>Water stress, crop yield, food waste, hunger, mineral demand, phosphorus reserves, and topsoil loss — the material foundation of civilization, projected by scenario.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--emerald">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">🎯</div>
    <h4>Timeline</h4>
    <p>Critical milestones from now to 2050, temperature and sea level trajectories, forest cover projections, and comprehensive scenario summaries of the road ahead.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Scenario-aware analysis

Every tab includes scenario-aware descriptions that update dynamically as you toggle between futures. Beneath each chart, a paragraph explains what that specific metric looks like under the selected scenario. At the bottom of each tab, a comprehensive summary synthesizes all the charts into a single narrative.

<div class="callout callout--tip">
  <p><strong>Try it:</strong> Switch from "Aggressive Action" to "Worst Case" and watch every metric shift. The descriptions aren't static — they tell a different story for each scenario, grounded in the numbers on the charts above them.</p>
</div>

This isn't about optimism or pessimism. It's about making the consequences of action and inaction concrete, visible, and comparable.

## How ClimateOS connects to the ecosystem

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p>ClimateOS is the <strong>environmental layer</strong>. It models the planetary systems that constrain everything else — the temperature, water, food, and biodiversity boundaries within which <a href="/civilization">CivilizationOS</a> builds civic infrastructure, <a href="/governance">GovernanceOS</a> designs institutions, and <a href="/transition">TransitionOS</a> manages workforce transitions. The <a href="/simulation">simulation toolkit</a> projects these constraints across 50 years and 12 policy branches.</p>
</div>

Climate is not a separate issue from governance, from economics, from civic life. It is the foundation layer. Every scenario modeled in the other tools implicitly assumes a climate trajectory. ClimateOS makes that trajectory explicit.
