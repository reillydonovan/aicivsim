  <h3>The playbook exists. The question is execution.</h3>
  <p>StrategyOS ranks personal, organizational, and policy strategies by real-world impact — and connects each action to the specific metrics it moves across ClimateOS, TransitionOS, GovernanceOS, and the rest of the ecosystem. This is the "so what?" that makes everything actionable.</p>
</div>

## The gap between knowing and doing

We've built dashboards that show where we stand ([ClimateOS](/climate)), where the workforce is headed ([TransitionOS](/transition)), how governance is performing ([GovernanceOS](/governance)), and what the aggregate picture looks like ([CivilizationOS](/civilization)). The [Simulation](/simulation) runs the macro model. Scorecard grades tell you the current state and scenario projections show possible futures.

But none of that answers the most important question: **what can I actually do about it?**

StrategyOS fills that gap. Every strategy is ranked by impact, tagged with cost and difficulty, linked to the ecosystem metric it moves, and explained in enough depth to actually act on.

  </div>

## Strategy Readiness Score

Just like ClimateOS has a Climate Score and CivilizationOS has a Health Index, StrategyOS opens with a **Strategy Readiness Score** — a composite grade measuring how prepared we are to execute across six domains.

| Domain | Aggressive | Moderate | Status Quo | Worst Case |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------|------------|
| Climate Action | B (78) ↑ | C (55) ↑ | D (35) ↓ | F (15) ↓ |
| Economic Transition | B- (72) ↑ | C- (50) → | D (32) ↓ | F (12) ↓ |
| Governance Quality | B- (68) ↑ | D+ (48) → | D (30) ↓ | F (10) ↓ |
| Social Equity | C+ (65) ↑ | C- (45) → | D- (28) ↓ | F (8) ↓ |
| Individual Agency | B+ (80) ↑ | C (58) ↑ | D- (38) → | F (20) ↓ |
| Systemic Readiness | B (74) ↑ | C- (52) → | D (30) ↓ | F (10) ↓ |
| **Overall** | **B (73)** | **C- (51)** | **D (32)** | **F (13)** |

Four scenarios drive every visualization, following the same pattern as the rest of the ecosystem. The overview includes aggregate projection charts for emissions, temperature, biodiversity, and equity — each with scenario-aware descriptive paragraphs explaining the trajectory.

<div class="callout callout--tip">
  <p><strong>Try it:</strong> Toggle from Aggressive Action to Active Regression and watch the Strategy Readiness Score drop from B to F. The radar chart reshapes entirely — from a balanced hexagon showing capability across all domains to a collapsed point showing systemic failure.</p>

## Personal Actions: what actually moves the needle

Most climate advice focuses on actions that feel virtuous but barely register. Skipping a plastic straw saves 1.5g of CO₂. Switching your energy provider saves 1,800 kg. Voting for candidates with credible climate plans can move gigatons.

StrategyOS ranks 25 personal strategies by actual impact — not by how satisfying they feel. Here are the top five:

<div class="steps">
  <div class="step">
    <h4>🗳️ Civic Engagement & Voting — Impact: 95</h4>
    <p>Your highest-leverage personal action. One well-designed regulation can achieve more than a million individual choices. Vote for candidates with credible climate and governance plans. Attend town halls. Comment on proposed regulations. Policy is the multiplier.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>🚌 EV or Public Transit Switch — Impact: 90</h4>
    <p>Replace combustion-engine commuting with an EV, e-bike, or transit pass. Saves 2,400 kg CO₂/yr. If an EV is unaffordable, a used hybrid or e-bike covers 80% of the benefit at 20% of the cost. Links to: <em>ClimateOS → Emissions intensity</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>🎓 Climate-Conscious Career Shift — Impact: 88</h4>
    <p>Reskill into climate tech, clean energy, or governance roles. Your career is a decades-long lever. TransitionOS shows the pathways; this is about choosing to walk one. The salary uplift for many transitions is positive.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>⚡ Switch to Renewable Energy — Impact: 85</h4>
    <p>Switch your electricity provider to 100% renewable. In deregulated markets this takes 15 minutes online. Saves 1,800 kg CO₂/yr — the single largest reduction from a single household action. Links to: <em>ClimateOS → Energy transition score</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>🏠 Home Energy Efficiency — Impact: 78</h4>
    <p>Heat pump, insulation, air sealing, LED lighting. Cuts heating/cooling energy by 50%. Rebates cover 30–60% of costs in many jurisdictions. Pays for itself in 3–7 years. Links to: <em>ClimateOS → Emissions intensity</em>.</p>
  </div>
</div>

All 25 actions span 8 categories — Energy, Food, Transport, Finance, Waste, Civic, Career, and Social — each with 3+ strategies. Every card shows CO₂ savings, cost rating, difficulty level, and which ecosystem dashboard it connects to.

## Organization Strategies: where personal intention meets systemic scale

A single company setting science-based targets moves more carbon than a thousand individuals changing light bulbs. Supply chain decarbonization alone can address 70–90% of most companies' total emissions.

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--emerald">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">🚛</div>
    <h4>Supply Chain Decarbonization</h4>
    <p>Impact: 95. Map, measure, and reduce Scope 3 emissions. This is where 70–90% of most companies' emissions live. Saves 120,000 tonnes CO₂/yr. Increasingly required by regulation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--sky">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">🎯</div>
    <h4>Science-Based Targets (SBTi)</h4>
    <p>Impact: 92. Validated near-term and net-zero targets that force internal accountability and align procurement. Companies with SBTi targets consistently outperform on decarbonization.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--violet">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">🤝</div>
    <h4>Just Transition Investment</h4>
    <p>Impact: 88. Fund reskilling for displaced workers. This is not charity — it's infrastructure for your future workforce. Companies that invest in transition build loyalty and earn social license.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--amber">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">🔋</div>
    <h4>100% Renewable Procurement</h4>
    <p>Impact: 85. Corporate PPAs directly finance new wind and solar. Long-term contracts provide price certainty. Many companies find renewables are now cheaper than fossil alternatives.</p>
  </div>
</div>

Eight strategies total, from AI Governance Frameworks (80) and Circular Economy (75) to Transparent ESG Reporting (70) and Remote Work Policy (60). Each connected to the ecosystem.

## Policy Interventions: the multiplier

Policy is where individual intention meets systemic scale. StrategyOS ranks 31 government and institutional levers across 11 categories, by cost-effectiveness and systemic leverage.

  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--rose">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">🌾</div>
    <h4>Food & Agriculture</h4>
    <p>Agricultural subsidy reform (81), sustainable protein transition (72), food waste regulation (69). Redirecting $540B/yr in subsidies from harm to health.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--emerald">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">❤️</div>
    <h4>Health & Environment</h4>
    <p>Air quality standards (76), environmental justice (74), climate-health integration (66). The co-benefits that make climate policy a public health imperative.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p>If every policy intervention were implemented at scale, the combined reduction potential exceeds <strong>22 Gt CO₂/yr</strong> — roughly 42% of current global emissions. No single policy is sufficient, but the combined effect creates a mutually reinforcing system where each policy amplifies the others.</p>
</div>

## Impact Simulator: "What if everyone did this?"

The Impact Simulator is the interactive punchline. Select any combination of 10 major strategies and watch the aggregate CO₂ reduction update in real time. A progress ring shows what percentage of global emissions (52 Gt/yr) your selection addresses.

<div class="steps">
  <div class="step">
    <h4>Select strategies</h4>
    <p>Toggle any combination of 10 interventions spanning personal (universal renewable energy, plant-forward diets, EV adoption), organizational (supply chain decarbonization), and policy (carbon pricing, clean electricity, methane regulation, building codes, nature-based solutions, transition programs).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>Watch the numbers</h4>
    <p>The progress ring fills as you add strategies. The bar chart breaks down each strategy's contribution by category. Select everything and you cut ~45 Gt — roughly 87% of global emissions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>Read the narrative</h4>
    <p>The summary adapts to your selection. Under 10 Gt is "a start — but more is needed." Over 20 Gt is "major progress." Over 30 Gt is "transformative." The narrative explains what your specific combination would achieve and where the gaps remain.</p>
  </div>
</div>

The point isn't to suggest anyone can personally implement a global carbon price. It's to show that the strategies exist, the math works, and the gap between where we are and where we need to be is bridgeable with known interventions at known costs.

## How StrategyOS connects to the ecosystem

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p>StrategyOS is the <strong>action layer</strong>. Every other dashboard in the ecosystem answers "where are we?" and "where are we headed?" StrategyOS answers "what do we do about it?" Each strategy card links to the specific metric it moves in <a href="/climate">ClimateOS</a>, <a href="/transition">TransitionOS</a>, <a href="/governance">GovernanceOS</a>, or <a href="/civilization">CivilizationOS</a>.</p>
</div>

The playbook is written. The dashboards show the score. The scenario projections show what's at stake. StrategyOS shows what to do about it — at every level, from the individual deciding what to change today to the policymaker designing the system that makes change inevitable.
