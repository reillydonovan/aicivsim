  <h3>What if we could run every possible future?</h3>
  <p>Imagine an infinite stack of simulations beginning right now. Each branches on every plausible decision we could make. We hit "run," then hit it again. What emerges if we keep iterating until "all that we've been seeking" finally shows itself?</p>
</div>

## What the sims teach immediately

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--sky">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">&#x1F9ED;</div>
    <h4>Values before probability</h4>
    <p>If we don't specify what "seeking" means — justice? abundance? stability? — we just drown in branching arithmetic.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--amber">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">&#x1F3D7;&#xFE0F;</div>
    <h4>Early constraints dominate</h4>
    <p>The first inputs we set (resource distribution, governance norms, who has veto power) show up in nearly every outcome.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--rose">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">&#x1F501;</div>
    <h4>Stubborn problems recur</h4>
    <p>No matter how far we roll the dice, unresolved energy, housing, and labor transitions resurface. Fix root causes or keep reliving variants of the same bottleneck.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--emerald">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">&#x1F331;</div>
    <h4>Small civic wins ripple</h4>
    <p>Adding participatory audits, open ledgers, or shared compute co-ops slightly tweaks millions of branches, often tipping them toward shared benefit.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card feature-card--violet">
    <div class="feature-card-icon">&#x26A1;</div>
    <h4>Agency beats prediction</h4>
    <p>Perfect foresight doesn't help if we don't act on it. The sim becomes a mirror reminding us the present is the only place we can exert force.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Running it again (and again)

Each replay becomes a lab note:

<div class="run-card run-card--red" data-run="#12">
  <p><strong>Frontier AI is proprietary, dividends aren't shared</strong> — polarization spikes.</p>
</div>

<div class="run-card run-card--green" data-run="#47">
  <p><strong>Open standards + Transition OS funding</strong> — slower short-term growth, but resilience metrics outpace every other branch after year five.</p>
</div>

<div class="run-card run-card--amber" data-run="#103">
  <p><strong>Climate VPPs scale but governance lags</strong> — grid stability improves, yet trust erodes, limiting adoption.</p>
</div>

<div class="run-card run-card--sky" data-run="#218">
  <p><strong>Civic dividends, participatory AI charters, and "public luxuries" baseline</strong> — after two decades, inequality curves flatten and cultural investments explode.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p>The point isn't to pick the "best" sim. It's to observe which ingredients consistently show up in futures we actually want to inhabit.</p>
</div>

## What we were seeking (revealed)

<div class="divider-label">Three through-lines that never leave</div>

<div class="steps">
  <div class="step">
    <h4>Transparent governance of powerful systems</h4>
    <p>Open weights, audit trails, and citizens with real override powers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>Shared upside</h4>
    <p>Dividends, co-ops, portable benefits. When people feel the gains, they participate more, lowering tail risks.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h4>Cultural + ecological care</h4>
    <p>Art, meaning, biodiversity restoration. Without them, even technically "successful" simulations feel hollow, and social cohesion collapses.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Bringing it back to now

<div class="callout callout--tip">
  <p>The simulation is just a story unless we translate it into the present. Here's how.</p>
</div>

<div class="highlight-strip">
  <div class="highlight-strip-icon">&#x1F4D3;</div>
  <div class="highlight-strip-body">
    <h4>Document the playbooks</h4>
    <p>Like the AI civilization strategy — so others can fork them, adapt them, and run their own versions.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="highlight-strip">
  <div class="highlight-strip-icon">&#x1F6E0;&#xFE0F;</div>
  <div class="highlight-strip-body">
    <h4>Build the tooling</h4>
    <p>Keep branching paths legible — Transition OS, civic ledgers, public VPP dashboards.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="highlight-strip">
  <div class="highlight-strip-icon">&#x1F504;</div>
  <div class="highlight-strip-body">
    <h4>Treat every deployment as another iteration</h4>
    <p>Better logging and shorter feedback loops. Each real-world rollout is a new run.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Explore the Transition OS dashboard</h3>
  <p>The reskilling platform described in the research paper is now an interactive dashboard. Browse 20 occupations by automation risk, explore ranked reskilling paths, see how Civic Dividends bridge income gaps, and compare three policy scenarios across eight KPIs over 10 years.</p>

  <h3>We don't need infinite compute.</h3>
  <p>We just need to notice the patterns that survive across every simulation, then act on them before the next branch begins.</p>
